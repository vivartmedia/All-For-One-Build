// Your name : Ashur Nanno

 // Exercise or Lab name : All For One - Build

 // Brief Description of what you did: Develop a 11-page application, with each page dedicated to a specific mini API endpoint challenge; hosted the api endpoints on Azure; and fetched all data local page using html, tailwind, flobite, and javascript.


// Peer Review:  George - Your code works only thing is the element in some pages are not exactly centered, it is specially noticable in the smaller screen; the home button is too big in smaller screens in my opinion. I like the style, coloring and background image.
